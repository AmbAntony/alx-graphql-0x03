## Objectives: 
This project implements an Error Boundary component in a Next.js application to gracefully handle JavaScript errors that occur during rendering. The solution includes creating an ErrorBoundary class component, integrating it with the application, testing it with an error-prone component, and adding error monitoring with Sentry.

## Instructions:

Create a project alx-rick-and-morty-app in alx-graphql-0x01 directory
Change directory into alx-rick-and-morty-app
Install the following dependencies:

npm install @apollo/client graphql
npm install @types/graphql

## Results
ErrorBoundary.tsx file provides a logged error in your monitoring service.
